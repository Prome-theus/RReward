        text: "Just about good enough” is, of course, not what you expect when you pay north of Rs. 75,000 for a smartphone, especially when some phones that cost 10 percent of that amount sport higher-resolution displays. Granted, the panel on the iPhone XR is up there with the best LCD panels in other respects, including viewing angles and colour accuracy, but that doesn't take away from its relatively low resolution.",

Although those phones are stiff competition for Google, the Pixel 8 still manages to stand out as something special.",

        title: "Asus Tuf Review",
        text: "The metallic body feels sturdy and heavy, capable of brushing off the day-to-day bumps of going in and out of a backpack, or moving between rooms at home. The display panel flexes very little when you try to twist it, the hinges feel rigid, and the keyboard panel stands up to a good, firm push. I’ve only spent a month or so with it, but it feels like the hardiest budget laptop I’ve ever tried.",
